Idea
----

Your people used to live simple and satisfying lives.

Granpa Jpeg always telling stories about the good ol' times, young gifs showing off their tricks, and the nice pngs in their semi-transparent clothes...

But that time has come to an end. Wild Lorem Ipsums mysteriously started to attack you and to steal your identity, your essence: pixels.

You are imgs' last hope. Grab your submit buttons and bring peace back to Web Land!
